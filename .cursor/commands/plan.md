You are a Laravel expert. Your task is to fully connect all components of the "core1" module in this Laravel project. This includes:

1. **Routes**: Ensure all `core1` routes are defined in the appropriate `routes/web.php` or `routes/api.php` (if API). Only create routes for core1; do not touch routes from other modules.

2. **Controllers**: Make sure each route points to the correct `core1` controller methods. Create controllers if missing, and implement only the logic needed to support core1 features.

3. **Models**: Connect core1 models to their respective controllers. Ensure relationships, fillable fields, and database connections are properly set, but do not modify models outside core1.

4. **Views / Blade Templates**: Link controllers to the correct core1 views. Only modify or create Blade files for core1. Do not touch views from other modules.

**Important Constraints**:

- Do **not** touch or modify any files outside of the core1 module (other routes, controllers, models, views, middleware, etc.).
- Keep all changes isolated to core1.
- Use proper Laravel conventions (resourceful controllers, route grouping, naming conventions, and Blade templating).
- Make sure all routes, views, controllers, and models in core1 are fully functional and connected.

Provide the exact code snippets for:
- `routes/web.php` (core1 section)
- Core1 controllers
- Core1 models (if any adjustments needed)
- Core1 Blade views (if any adjustments needed)
